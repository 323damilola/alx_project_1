## Our Process

This project started by writing the main codes in HTML and styling it in CSS. Also, CSS bootstrap was used in some aspects and added fontawesome CDN in the stylesheet so I could be able to use some icons. Furthermore, some JavaScript functionalities were added as part of the back-end specifically in the sign up and login forms. 

### Built With 

- HTML5 Markup
- CSS Styling
- JavaScript

### What We Learned 

This project taught a valuable lessons to me in front-end development, user experience design, JavaScript interactivity, and considerations for backend functionality and security. Through team collaboration with myself and myself, I learnt about version control, communication, and project management and also never to work alone. I also gained insights into testing, debugging, continuous learning, and basic eCommerce concepts, ultimately enhancing my technical skills and understanding of online business dynamics.

These resources helped when I got stuck on how the layout of the website should be like and also when I was contemplating on which sections to add in the categories page.
